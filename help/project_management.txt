-----------------
==> current tasks
-----------------
- review all the TODOs and add backlog items for the important or large scale ones:
  - stopped analyzing at the file win32_platform.cpp

-----------------------
==> categorized backlog
-----------------------
tests:
  - improve compilation tests console messages:
    - info messages should denote the beginning and ending of the test clearly,
      because all the tests are usually run sequentially and output in a single log.

x86_real:
  - fix the file system library in x86_real platform:
    - creating files in sub-directories does not work properly.

os:
  - continue work on the project.

build system:
  - solve the environment setup issue where watcom paths will contain tools that
    conflict with msvc tools also included in path.

handmade_hero:
  - continue work on the project.
  - resolve all the TODOs.

ray_tracer:
  - fix BRDF table lookup or use a different BRDF implementation.

lint:
  - make linting smarter by not having to touch all the files every time.
  - only lint files that were modified since last lint time.
  - this requires that we save the last lint time in a metadata .json file.

compilation_tests:
  - failed tests have extra error information provided.
  - build dependency graph of #include'ed files in compile targets.
  - store the test results permanently, with info about dependencies.
  - check on the last modification before running a test for a target.
  - only rerun the test if necessary, meaning, if one of the target
    dependencies changed since the last test run.

win32/shared:
  - resolve all the TODOs.
  - create tests for the math library.
