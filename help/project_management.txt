==> backlog
-----------
- update the documentation of the directory structure.
- improve compilation tests console messages:
    - info messages should denote the beginning and ending of the test clearly,
      because all the tests are usually run sequentially and output in a single log.
- fix the file system library in x86_real platform:
  - creating files in sub-directories does not work properly,
    check the TODOs there.
