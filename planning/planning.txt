=====================
        bugs
=====================
- build system bugs
     - refterm folder is not deleted by "build clean".
     - called fromt the build system "clean_all" command context, the EmptyDirectory()
     function doesn't have a console output when it succeeds/fails in deleting files.

==================================
     build system improvement
==================================
- build tool
     - add a way to get and compare last modified time of the files
     - skip rebuilding of object files if their inputs (source files and their headers) haven't changed
     - add function to analyze source code files and determine all of their dependencies
     - add a command to try to compile a single source file to make development faster

- create a tool to determine unnecessary header file dependencies in sources
     - the command will parse source code files and find the #included headers
     - the command will try to determine if the headers are needed or not
     - the tool will try to compile the source file without the header file
     - if the build succeeds, the header file is then unnecessary and can be removed
     - the tool will create a report of the unnecessary header #includes

=========================================
     x86 operating system development
=========================================
- overall code review for the i686-elf platform source code
- allow access for BIOS functions both through real & protected 32-bit mode
