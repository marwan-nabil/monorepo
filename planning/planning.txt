===============================
        build system bugs
===============================
- refterm folder is not deleted by "build clean".
- called fromt the build system "clean_all" command context, the EmptyDirectory()
function doesn't have a console output when it succeeds/fails in deleting files.

==================================
     build system improvement
==================================
- add a command to try to compile a single source file to make development faster

- create a tool to determine unnecessary header file dependencies in sources
     - the command will parse source code files and find the #included headers
     - the command will try to determine if the headers are needed or not
     - the tool will try to compile the source file without the header file
     - if the build succeeds, the header file is then unnecessary and can be removed
     - the tool will create a report of the unnecessary header #includes

- make build system bootstrapping faster
     - script should not recompile all files all over again everytime

- transition the build system to be artifact based
     - build system shall have declarative descriptions of the build dependencies
     - this description, specified in json files, shall be loaded at runtime
     - after the description is loaded, it shall be converted into the in-memory representation
     - after loading, the cross references between build objects shall be resolved
     - after the resolution of references, an action graph shall be created
     - the action grap specifies the needed actions to achieve the build target
     - the action graph specifies the dependencies between the actions
     - action graph shall allow the build tool to parallelize the execution of unrelated branches of the graph
     
=========================================
     x86 operating system development
=========================================
- overall code review for the i686-elf platform source code
- allow access for BIOS functions both through real & protected 32-bit mode
